            For Acting has the power to make people believe in things they know aren’t true. 

When you are at your wits end and your reputation is being ransacked by your own cronies you go back to only one option that you have “Acting”, such is the sheer power of acting that it can even get a bawdy guy look innocent and it can even make a slumdog look like a millionaire. In search of this talent, The Dramatics Club of IIT Patna presents “NaatyaRangam”, the Intra College Dramatics Competition.

Reading a script, rehearsing dialogues and acting out pre-meditatedly on stage. Is that the best you have in store? If not, then this is the stage for you. Theatre is more than just remembering a few lines and acting them out. It’s about versatility, spontaneity and presence of mind.

Show the various facets of the art that is theatre and prove that “All the world’s a stage”. Enact your way through the given situation, garnish it with emotions and blow away the audience. 

The stage is set, the curtain is raised and you are in the limelight. So step on the stage & improvise, perform and mesmerise.
